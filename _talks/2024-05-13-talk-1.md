In May 2024, I gived presentation for our published paper [**Efficient heatmap-guided 6-DoF grasp detection in cluttered scenes**](/publication/2023-06-29-Efficient-2) in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2024), Yokohama, Japan. I am quite excited for my first academic presentation in an international conference and hope to attend more conferences in the near future.
