Image engineering is a new interdisciplinary field that systematically studies various image theories, technologies, and applications. Its content can be divided into three layers: image processing, image analysis, and image understanding. This course is the first one in the image course, mainly introducing low-level content, with a certain depth and breadth. Through the study of this course, readers can solve some practical application problems of image technology on the one hand, and on the other hand, it will also lay a foundation for further learning of mid to high-level technologies in image engineering.
