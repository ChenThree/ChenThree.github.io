I am a third-year PhD student at Visual Computing Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Guijin Wang. Previously I received my bachelorâ€™s degree at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University in July, 2021.

My current research focus is on robot manipulation, embodied AI and applications of 3D scene understanding.
